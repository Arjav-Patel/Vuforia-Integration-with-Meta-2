# Vuforia Integration with Meta2
A guide on using Vuforia with the Meta 2 headset

Check out the Wiki for instructions

I recommend following along with the Wiki to make sure everything is correct.

UPDATE:

I made a couple minor changes so that the rendering issues are fixed. The cube will now stop rendering when the marker is lost.
The relevant changes are in STEP 7, and STEP 11.

If I forgot anything, or something does not work, open up an issue and I'll try to help.
