Check out the Wiki for instructions.

I recommend following along with the Wiki to make sure everything is correct.

> IMPORTANT: importing the package might break some dependacies. If it does, just follow the tutorial, and it'll allow you to re-create the project from scratch in about 10 minutes.

For example, one thing which will definitely not import correctly are the Player settings. 

Also, the wiki goes over how to do "custom" calibration.

UPDATE:

I made a couple minor changes so that the rendering issues are fixed. The cube will now stop rendering when the marker is lost.
The relevant changes are in STEP 7, and STEP 11.

If I forgot anything, or something does not work, open up an issue and I'll try to help.
